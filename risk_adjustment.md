Automating the risk adjustment of CVEs involves dynamically tailoring CVSS scores or other risk metrics based on the specific attributes of the systems, applications, and environments in which the vulnerabilities exist. Below are some considerations that cvss-updater can make use of when performing this process. Not all are currently implemented and a TODO would be to use RAG to include with an LLM inference.

---

### **1. Host Configuration and Security Posture**

#### **SELinux, AppArmor, or Similar Security Frameworks**
- **Impact**: If SELinux or AppArmor is enabled and properly configured, exploitability may be reduced for certain vulnerabilities, particularly those targeting system-level access.
- **Automation**:
  - Query SELinux/AppArmor status and profiles via APIs or system commands.
  - Adjust scores for vulnerabilities that would be mitigated by these configurations.

#### **Kernel Hardening**
- **Impact**: Kernel hardening (e.g., Grsecurity, KSPP) can reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation of kernel-level vulnerabilities.
- **Automation**:
  - Detect hardened kernel features (e.g., `sysctl` parameters).
  - Adjust CVSS scores for kernel-related vulnerabilities.

#### **System Update State**
- **Impact**: A fully patched system may mitigate certain vulnerabilities.
- **Automation**:
  - Check the package manager for available updates.
  - Lower scores for patched systems or vulnerabilities marked as "will be fixed" in the next update cycle.

#### **Filesystem Configurations**
- **Impact**: Read-only filesystems, immutable binaries, or mounted volumes with `noexec` flags can limit certain attack vectors.
- **Automation**:
  - Detect filesystem flags (`/etc/fstab`, `mount`).
  - Adjust scores for vulnerabilities requiring writable/exec privileges.

### **2. Asset Type and Deployment Context**

#### **Containers vs Virtual Machines vs Bare Metal**
- **Impact**:
  - **Containers**: Vulnerabilities impacting a containerized process might have lower severity if the container is sandboxed.
  - **VMs**: Exploits requiring direct hardware access may not apply to virtualized systems.
  - **Bare Metal**: Highest risk for vulnerabilities affecting the entire host.
- **Automation**:
  - Identify asset type using orchestration APIs (e.g., Kubernetes, VMware vSphere).
  - Adjust CVSS scores based on isolation strength and exploit requirements.

#### **Cloud vs On-Premises**
- **Impact**:
  - Cloud providers often enforce additional security controls (e.g., hypervisor protections, managed IAM).
  - On-premises environments may lack similar controls, increasing risk.
- **Automation**:
  - Use cloud APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP) to detect deployment type and inherited security controls.
  - Adjust risk based on platform protections.

### **3. Network Exposure**

#### **Open Ports and Listening Services**
- **Impact**:
  - Services exposing vulnerable ports to the Internet face higher risk.
  - Vulnerabilities in local-only services have reduced impact.
- **Automation**:
  - Perform port scans and service fingerprinting (e.g., with `nmap`).
  - Correlate services to CVEs and adjust scores for public-facing services.

#### **Network Segmentation**
- **Impact**:
  - Hosts in well-segmented networks (e.g., internal-only or air-gapped environments) face lower exploitation risks.
- **Automation**:
  - Query firewall rules, VLAN configurations, or cloud security groups.
  - Apply lower scores for assets behind robust segmentation.

#### **Public Internet Exposure**
- **Impact**:
  - Publicly exposed hosts (e.g., web servers) face heightened risk.
- **Automation**:
  - Check DNS records and IP ranges to identify public-facing assets.
  - Increase scores for vulnerabilities affecting these systems.

### **4. Application Context**

#### **Running Applications**
- **Impact**:
  - Certain vulnerabilities only matter if specific applications are running (e.g., a MySQL vulnerability only impacts systems running MySQL).
- **Automation**:
  - Inventory installed/running applications via package managers, process lists, or orchestration APIs.
  - Adjust scores for non-applicable vulnerabilities.

#### **Web Servers**
- **Impact**:
  - If a vulnerable web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) is present, certain vulnerabilities become critical.
- **Automation**:
  - Detect server software and configurations (e.g., via HTTP headers or system-level probes).
  - Adjust scores for CVEs affecting detected web servers.

---

### **5. Environment Sensitivity**

#### **Production vs Non-Production**
- **Impact**:
  - Vulnerabilities in production environments may pose higher risk than in dev/test systems.
- **Automation**:
  - Query tagging systems (e.g., AWS tags, asset databases) for environment labels.
  - Increase scores for production assets.

#### **Data Sensitivity**
- **Impact**:
  - Systems storing sensitive data (e.g., PII, PHI, financial records) face greater consequences from exploitation.
- **Automation**:
  - Integrate with CMDBs (Configuration Management Databases) or data discovery tools to classify systems.
  - Adjust scores for assets with critical data.

#### **Critical Infrastructure**
- **Impact**:
  - Vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure (e.g., healthcare, utilities) may have higher real-world consequences.
- **Automation**:
  - Identify critical systems based on asset categorization and tags.
  - Elevate scores for vulnerabilities in such systems.

### **6. Vulnerability-Specific Context**

#### **Exploit Availability**
- **Impact**:
  - Active exploits or public PoCs increase risk.
- **Automation**:
  - Monitor threat intelligence feeds (e.g., ExploitDB, CISA) to detect exploit availability.
  - Increase scores for vulnerabilities with known exploits.

#### **Vendor Mitigations**
- **Impact**:
  - If a vendor has issued specific mitigations or configuration changes to reduce impact, scores can be reduced.
- **Automation**:
  - Scrape vendor advisories and correlate mitigations with asset configurations.
  - Adjust scores if mitigations are applied.

---

### **7. User Interaction and Behavior**

#### **User Access Patterns**
- **Impact**:
  - Vulnerabilities requiring user interaction (e.g., phishing-based exploits) may pose less risk in environments with limited user access.
- **Automation**:
  - Analyze user behavior data or access logs.
  - Lower scores for vulnerabilities requiring active user involvement.

#### **Privileges**
- **Impact**:
  - Systems with strong least-privilege enforcement may reduce the impact of privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
- **Automation**:
  - Assess IAM policies and user roles on hosts.
  - Adjust scores for vulnerabilities requiring higher privilege escalation.

---

### **8. Real-Time Threat Context**

#### **Threat Intelligence Feeds**
- **Impact**:
  - Real-world exploitation in the wild dramatically increases urgency.
- **Automation**:
  - Integrate with real-time feeds (e.g., CISA KEV, CVE Trends).
  - Dynamically elevate scores for active threats.

#### **Attack Surface Analysis**
- **Impact**:
  - Vulnerabilities on exposed or actively targeted systems require prioritization.
- **Automation**:
  - Use attack surface management tools to correlate vulnerabilities with exposed systems.
  - Automatically flag high-risk CVEs for immediate remediation.

### **Final Thought**

To implement automated risk adjustment effectively:
- **Centralize Data Collection**: Integrate with asset management, network monitoring, threat intelligence, and orchestration APIs.
- **Correlate Context Dynamically**: Build a rules engine or AI model to evaluate risk based on the combined factors.
- **Visualize Impact**: Use dashboards to present adjusted risks for better decision-making.

This approach turns static CVSS scores into dynamic, context-aware risk ratings tailored to the organization's unique environment and threat landscape. Let me know if you'd like help expanding on any of these ideas! ðŸš€
